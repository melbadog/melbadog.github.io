        Start me with 3/4 a cup of food and a full bowl of water, but give me more if I want it!
        I don't always finish my food, but make sure I am not too distracted while eating.
        If there's a lot going on, you may need to sit and keep me focused.</p>
        <p>
            I like most kinds of treats, but don't give me people food.
            The few exceptions are peanut butter, cream cheese, or string cheese in small quantities if I really deserve a reward.

        <td>
            <p>I sleep in my crate at night, going to bed around 10 or 11 PM and waking up around 6 AM.
            Sometimes I sleep in later if I'm really tired.
            If I whimper or bark in the middle of the night, or first thing in the morning, it means I have to go to the bathroom!
            I'm usually happy to spend a bit more time in my crate after my morning bathroom trip if you want to sleep in.
           
            </p>
            <p>
 I like having a large crate divided in half so it's nice and cozy.  Please put a towel or dog bed down for me, and leave my lobster toy inside to keep me company.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you need to leave me alone during the day, I can stay in my crate for about three hours at a time.  
                Just make sure I've had a chance to go to the bathroom first!

        <td><h1>Poop</h1></td>
        <td>
            <p>I poop about three times a day, usually once right when I wake up, once around lunch, and once in the evening.
            Sometimes I  realize I have to go during a meal, so if I pause eating and start barking, it's a good idea to take me out.
            Say "go potty" to get me going once we're outside. 
            Make sure to have a treat ready in case I drop a big one!</p>
            <p>I need to go out to pee every 2-3 hours.  After peeing, I may run back toward the house.  But if I haven't pooped for a while, make sure to encourage me to stay out and give it a try.</p>

        <td><h1>Play</h1></td>
        <td>I sleep better when I've had good play time during the day.
            A romp with some of my dog friends or a 30 minute walk will make sure I sleep well at night.
            I'm not allowed to jump on the couch, but I always forget this.  Keep reminding me!
            I am usually good running around the house, but you should watch me and make sure I don't chew on anyting I shouldn't.
