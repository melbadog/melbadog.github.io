        <td><h1>Morning</h1></td>
        <td> Melba usually starts her day at 7-8am.  Once we let her out of the crate, she usually jumps on the bed for some morning petting.  We give her water and breakfast (3/4 cup kirkland signature puppy food) and usually include 1-2 treats on top of the food to get her attention.  She usually eats some but not all of her breakfast, and we leave it out for her to graze as long as she wants.  Melba usually goes to the bathroom first thing in the morning.

            <p>      
Melba doesn't get a separate lunch, but she can feel free to work on her breakfast leftovers. Melba usually has to go to the bathroom 2-3 times during the day.  Depending on her energy level, we often take her for a 1-3 mile walk during the day.  She has also had fun at Magnuson dog park.

Melba gets another 3/4 cup of food at night, again with 1-2 treats on top and water.  If Melba goes pee and poop after about 9PM, she will usually sleep soundly in her crate through the night.

            <p>      
Melba plays with toys, other dogs (if around), or naps.  If she brings you a toy, chances are she wants to play tug-of-war with you.  When Melba plays with other dogs, she often likes getting chased.  Sometimes she gets in "hyper" mode and likes to hide under any couch, table, or chair she can fit under, and she may bark or growl. 
 This can mean she needs exercise, needs to go to the bathroom, or needs some crate time.

        <td>
            <p>      
 Melba likes beef liver, pizzle sticks, and most meat-based treats.  She is less interested in crunchy treats but will eat them sometimes.  For a special reward, we give her a tiny bite of string cheese or a spoon with peanut butter to lick (her favorite).  Otherwise, we don't feed her any human food.
